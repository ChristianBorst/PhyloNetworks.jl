# `PhyloNetworks`

PhyloNetworks is a Julia package for the manipulation, visualization
and inference of phylogenetic networks.  SNaQ implements the
statistical inference method in [Sol&iacute;s-Lemus and
An&eacute;](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06075.pdf). The procedure
involves a numerical optimization of branch lengths and inheritance
probabilities and a heuristic search in the space of phylogenetic
networks.
